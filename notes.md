## Claim

I claim, that you only need the following tools in your personal dev environment. 

For development:
- A code editor (like VS Code)
- git
- docker

Base:
- Browser
- Application Bar

## Survey

### Basics
- What OS do you use?
- What's your preferred code editor?

### Personal Environments
- How many devices (or personal dev environments) do you have?
  - Personal Computer / Notebook
  - Work Computer / Notebook
  - Virtual Machines
- How many open projects do you have?
  - Amount
  - Countless, because I have a lot of work to do
  - Countless, because I rarely finish private projects

### Editor (VS-Code) Extensions

- How many extensions do you have installed in your code editor?
- What extensions do you use all the time?
- What extensions do you use in many projects?
- What extensions do you use only in a few projects?
- What extensions do you have installed, that you do not use?
- Do your extensions differ from machine to machine?

### Management 

- Do you use any kind of management for your environments?
  - A .config-Repository
  - Install scripts
  - 3rd party tools
  - good documentation
  - something else
